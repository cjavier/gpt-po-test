# Sync Widget

User friendly web interface to make use of Paybook's Sync services.

# Quick Start

## Installation

Sync Widget can be installed via npm. It is recommended to get Sync Widget this way.

```
npm install --save @paybook/sync-widget
```

**Note**: You'll need to have npm 2.7.0 or greater installed, since this library is hosted as a [scoped package](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/scoped-packages).

## Integration

### Using bundlers (Webpack)

Import styles

```
import "@paybook/sync-widget/dist/widget.css";
```

Import SyncWidget class

```
import SyncWidget from "@paybook/sync-widget";
```

## Usage

### Creating an instance

To create an instance of SyncWidget, you need to create an element in the DOM with a unique selector. By default SyncWidget will search for "#widget". Here's an example.

```
<div id="widget"></div>
```
**Note**: The widget will replace this element.

Once you have the element, you're ready to instantiate a new SyncWidget with your desired configuration.

```
// Any of the following formats may be used

var syncWidget = new SyncWidget("sync_token");

var syncWidget = new SyncWidget({
        token: "sync_token"
    });
    
var syncWidget = new SyncWidget({
        token: "sync_token",
        element: "#widget",
        config: {
            locale: "es", 
            entrypoint: {
                country: "MX"
            }
        }
    });

```
